  <h2>Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h2>
  
  <p>As part of the module GEOG 5990M, I have been learning the core principles of programming using Python, with classes leading towards the development of a simple agent based model (ABM).</p>
  <p>The aim of this project was to build a simple ABM which included basic agents and read in an 'environment' through web-scraping. The agents interactions are modelled within the environment and include simple behaviours like moving, eating and sharing their store of food with their neighbours within a set radius.</p>
  
  <p>More information and code for the final ABM and Agent Framework, along with earlier versions of the model, can be found in the associated Github repository by clicking the links below.</p>
