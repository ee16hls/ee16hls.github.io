  <p>As part of the module GEOG 5990M, I have been learning the core principles of programming using Python, with classes leading towards the development of a simple agent based model (ABM).</p>
  <p>The code for the final ABM and Agent Framework, along with earlier versions of the model, can be found in the Github repository below.</p>
