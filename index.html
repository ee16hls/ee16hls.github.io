		<h2>Welcome to my Homepage!</h2>
			
			<p>I am a PhD student with the CDT Bioenergy at the University of Leeds and have an MSc in Climate Change and Environmnetal Policy and an undergraduate background in Geography.</p>
			<p>My research project focuses on sustainable use of bioenergy in tea production landscapes in Kenya and is funded by EPSRC. For this project I am working in partnership with UK tea suppliers Taylor's of Harrogate and am affiliated with the United Bank of Carbon (UBoC).</p> 
			<p>This personal site hosts a portfolio of my work and links to the associated Github repositories for the module GEOG 5990M with the School of Geography where I have been learning the basics of programming for geographic data analysis.</p>
