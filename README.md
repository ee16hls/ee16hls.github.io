# ee16hls.github.io

This is my personal website with Github pages which has been created to host my portfolio of work for the module GEOG 5990M at the University of Leeds, with links to the associated Github repository. 

This website has been built by following the online guide to building a Github page by Jonathan McGlone available at http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/. Additions have been made to this personal page by creating lists, adding colour to text and including an image of a project output.
